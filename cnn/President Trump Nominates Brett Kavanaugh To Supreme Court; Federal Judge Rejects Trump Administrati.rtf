And David Axelrod, if this were happening to a Democratic President and others would probably feel the same way. I mean, the President needs to be removed from these types of games played, you see this going on in several states where people are indicted, who are in public office and it's just all political. And the President can't be bogged down with things like that. There is a place for this to be handled, and it's through the impeachment process.}

The Thai Navy source saying in that mountain behind me, deep in those cabins, the elite divers have gone and again to try bring the remaining four boys and their coach out. Even though they succeeded twice, Anderson, this is still going to be a very difficult operation.

That's a catchment (ph) area behind me, as it streams into the cave. They will be working against the clock. They managed to pull off the impossible. The question is, can they do it again?
