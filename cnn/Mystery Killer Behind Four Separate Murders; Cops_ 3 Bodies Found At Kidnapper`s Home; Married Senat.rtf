You know, you can say suspect since he killed himself at the extended stay hotel this morning. Dwight Lamon Jones, they have been calling him the killer, the murderer, connected to all four of the murders in the Scottsdale, Phoenix area last week and now connected to two additional murders, a man and woman found in a home in the Fountain Hills area.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 I`m going to tell you the very strange connection that we`ve now learned between all of these victims. They all go back to the 2009-2010 divorce case that Dwight Jones had with his wife at the time. We`ve now learned that that case required Dwight Jones to see a psychiatrist by the name of Dr. Pitt, victim number one.}
{\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24\par}\pard\plain\itap0\s0\fi0\sb200\sa0\aspalpha\aspnum\adjustright\ltrpar\li0\lin0\ri0\rin0\qj\faauto\sl260\slmult0\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24{\rtlch\af2\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\b0\i0\fs20\lang1024\langnp1033\langfe1024\langfenp1033
\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 So Dr. Pitt is sort of the famous forensic scientist, a forensic psychiatrist to the stars. Steven Pitt was involved in the JonBenet Ramsey case, the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case, the Ben Roethlisberger case, Jodi Arias. He was well-known in the community because he had done a lot of high-profile cases.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 So the connection to the killer is that he was required to see this psychiatrist in his divorce case. Now it gets a little more bizarre. Another psychiatrist was brought into that divorce case as well named Elizabeth Feldman. And the child of this couple, of Dwight Jones and his wife, was required to see Elizabeth Feldman.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 The police think she was the target, at least the second target. And when Dwight Jones went to her office to kill her, she wasn`t there. But victims number two and three were. Valeria Sharp and Laura Anderson were apparently at that -- excuse me, Marshall Levine. Excuse me, Marshall Levine was at that office. He shared space with Elizabeth Feldman, the intended target.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 Marshall Levine is not necessarily connected to the divorce case. I think it`s an unfortunate circumstance that he happened to be in the office space where Elizabeth Feldman shared this office. She was the target of Dwight Jones.

We have been following breaking news tonight that`s really sort of been jaw dropping in terms of this story that`s come out of Phoenix, Scottsdale area about a spree killing that up until tonight we thought might have been four victims, but ultimately the suspect who is now dead, Dwight Jones, it looks like he is now responsible for at least six victims.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 I think this also goes to a larger issue. They have leveled some sex charges here, so there`s obviously something here to that, that this was an ongoing issue. In addition to that, they are taking their time going over every inch of this property with this ground penetrating radar. And I find it curious that they would go out and excavate these areas. You mentioned just a moment ago how you can`t necessarily see an absolute body, but there will be an anomaly in the soil. Remember, when you fill in a hole after you have dug it up, the soil never goes back into the way it normally -- the way it appears in nature. So you will get this anomalous blob, if you will, and you can make out some features at that time. That requires further investigation. They are not just looking for bodies, but they are also looking for any type of evidence, say weapons or something that would have facilitated the death of these women.}

So, it`s going to give law enforcement a chance to dig into whether there`s a connection between Weldon and these women, and let`s look into the computer forensics. There`s got to be some computer track, phone evidence to connect Weldon, hopefully, with these three women. But, I mean, from a circumstantial standpoint right now, it obviously doesn`t look good for him.}

How does he skate from having sex with a minor, and every other charge, like the marijuana, and all the drugs he was plying the kid with, and instead, he ends up with just this one plea to federal child sex trafficking, and is there something good about that? Those two questions and those two answers when we come back.}

And tonight, we`re learning more about how he lured multiple under aged boys. Prosecutor saying he, quote, exerted undue influence by enticing Doe -- and Doe is that boy in the motel room.

So, these are things that we take very seriously and the squads that work this particular violation, it happens to be the only violation in the FBI that you can opt out of.

I`m looking at this and I`m sort of gob smacked by the idea that all he has pled to is a count of federal child sex trafficking. When in fact, he was facing child porn, there were three federal charges of child porn that were dropped and then state charges of engaging in child prostitution, transporting a minor for prostitution and lewdness with a minor. So, get me off the ledge, Brian Claypool, and tell me why this is a good thing that it`s just one charge and it`s federal child sex trafficking -- ten years to life. Tell me why this is a good thing and other charges were dropped.}

Yes, he goes to pick it up and watch the flash. See that? It went off. It was unbelievable. They just walk it off. His gun goes off and he just walks out of the circle, throws his hands in the air, whatever, big -- no biggie. Well, it turns out there was a biggie. A man was shot in the leg and then taken to the hospital. Non-life threatening injuries, thank God, but police are testing whether alcohol was involved in all of this and charges could correspond to this and be forthcoming.
