\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 The reason that only four boys have made it out so far, according to authorities is because of oxygen supplies inside that cave. Over the last couple of days, Brian, what's happened is on a guideline all through the cave that these four boys actually followed, about five kilometers long in order to get out, they stationed oxygen tanks all along that route to make sure as these boys were going out using diving equipment don't forget they had oxygen on their way out. Those supplies were apparently depleted to the point that they cannot continue the rescue operation tonight.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And so, what's happening is professional divers and international effort including Thai, American, Australian, British divers are going into that cave, refueling those oxygen tanks and the hope is to get this rescue operation started again, to get the nine remaining nine members of that soccer team and their coach out of that cave as soon as possible because, Brian, it's July in Thailand, it is the rainy season, it is going to start raining very hard, very soon and when those water levels rise, that could mean it's too late to get the nine remaining people trapped in that cave out safely.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 STELTER: Yes, good reminder about the coach as well as the eight boys who are still inside. And already there has been one death associated with this rescue mission. One of the workers, one of the rescuers who was trying to prepare the cave. What do we know about him? What do we know about the man who died?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 RIVERS: Yes, this was a former Thai Navy SEAL, a Thai diver, a 38- year-old triathlete who actually lost his life bringing in some of those oxygen containers that I was talking about, he apparently ran out of air and died himself. And that's why when we're talking about how unbelievably dangerous this rescue attempt is, that is the most heartbreaking example that we can share with our viewers, that this professional diver, someone who was in the Thai navy, he was a Navy SEAL, actually lost his life in the same passage ways that these four boys just circumnavigated. I mean, that is unbelievable.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And so, when we are talking about this rescue mission at least so far being a success, Brian, 15 hours ago, I was standing outside that cave entrance saying that that was far from guaranteed. This is miraculous that four boys are now safely inside that hospital especially when you consider that a 38-year-old triathlete, former professional diver, lost his life doing what he could to save these boys.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And just real quick, I mean, the fact that that man volunteered to give his time and his expertise shows you that this country and its armed forces and its citizens have gotten behind this rescue effort in a truly emblematic way. I can't give enough credit to the volunteers that we have seen come out from all over this country to do what they can as this country remains transfixed on trying to get some of its youngest citizens and their coach out of that cave.}

You know, I've been working overnights here over the last couple days and so I would show up to the cave entrance usually around 11:00 p.m. And, yes, it was a controlled setting in the sense that there was a lot of authorities there, but generally speaking, you were free to go just about everywhere but the cave itself.}

They kicked all media out and that was really our first indication that something is happening. So, generally, speaking the Thai authorities have been very accommodating to the press and have been very forthcoming with information and it's a testament to their ability to communicate.}

When Hannity is off the air, he gossips with Trump and gives advice about who to hire. So let's just underscore how weird this is. No T.V. host has ever had this kind of relationship with a U.S. President before. And to take it a step further, no network has ever propped up a president quite like this before. Sure, Obama had big fans on MSNBC but there wasn't this kind of constant coordination. No one ever thought Keith Olbermann was Obama's shadow chief of staff but that's how some Trump advisors described Hannity. This is new and it's weird and we shouldn't get used to it. There's been almost a merger between a culture war T.V. station and a culture war president. Now it started as a mere acquaintance. Look at this.

Now as of Saturday afternoon Trump was still undecided according to the New York Times but he has decided to reveal a nominee Monday 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. It sounds like something out of The Apprentice. The White House took the rare step of formally requesting airtime from the major networks so we know what's going to happen.

It gives them a lock on the court. And I'm not saying that every case will turn out. We will have surprises. There will be some cases that turn out not as one expects and I don't think the justices themselves are partisans but they do have -- they do have legal ideologies. And the people who are being seriously looked at here have the legal ideology of Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. Scalia being slightly considerably actually to the left of Justice Thomas and that means that the John Roberts the Chief Justice a firm conservative vote who I think is voted with all the Liberals and been the swing vote maybe four times, five times in his tenure on the court since 2005. He will now be the quote swingman. Well, that's a pretty conservative swingman.}
