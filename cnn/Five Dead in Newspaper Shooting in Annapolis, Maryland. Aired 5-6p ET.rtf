They're going to do that.}

\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 Secondly, there was this question which we've been reporting on for about the last half hour, and that's what were the circumstances surrounding the shooter being taken into custody.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 In this case, the subject was taken into custody.

And one thing that stands out to me from the press conference is that he was transported directly to the police station in order to be interrogated, which says that he wasn't injured. He didn't need to be taken to the hospital. So again, a lot of questions: did he -- did he go there intending to make it out alive and then simply decide that he was going to give up, or were there other factors there?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 The last thing, Wolf, real quickly, is when you look at the type of weaponry that was used, a shotgun. Now, I can tell you, you know, having a bit familiar with the shotgun, you don't simply pick up this type of firearm and use it accurately. It's a very violent type of weapon with, you know, a very strong recoil that takes practice. So this person, again, there's a lot we don't know. But that particular use of a weapon with a shotgun tells me that he at least knew his way around a weapon.}

And the longer we go without knowing who this individual is, the longer -- the more concerned I become because we need to make absolutely sure that when this individual made a decision to not disclose his identity, that that did not mean that he was holding for something else to happen in this -- in this tragedy. So, I think having a police presence on the scene, a large police presence is about making sure that we talk to absolutely everyone who was there. And as Josh pointed out, to make sure that there's no one who's ever seen this individual or who remembers something that might give police some clue as to who this individual is and where he came from.}

A statement put out by John Miller who's the Deputy Commissioner for Counterterrorism and Intelligence for NYPD, for the New York Police Department, he said this, and I'll read it because I think it's significant. "The NYPD is monitoring reports of an active shooter at the Capital Gazette media organization in Annapolis, Maryland. The NYPD has deployed counterterrorism teams to media organizations in and around New York City. These deployments are not based on specific threat information but rather out of an abundance of caution until we learn more about the suspect and motives behind the Maryland shooting. It has become a standard practice to shift resources strategically during active shooter or terrorist events."}

You have this devastated, hear- broken person talking a little bit about what the community service that this newspaper provides to his local community and some of the responses are just vicious, there are terrible people who are essentially responding to this tragedy in that way. And so, that's the reason why police have been sent to the Baltimore Sun Newsroom, as well, because just as a precaution.

\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 KRAMPF: Deputy Chief William Krampf, Anne Arundel County Police Department. So, the building as we speak is now tactically secured, and what that means is our SWAT team and our quick responders have been through the building. It is secure as far as there are no more persons in the building that are a threat to anyone else. We did recover what we thought may have been an explosive device. That has been taken care of. We have members of the bomb squad on scene. We don't anticipate having any more explosive devices. What is happening now that you see behind me is that our criminal investigation division, the actual investigators, are now taking over the scene. We have released it to our members of the criminal investigation division so they can start the process of identifying what occurred, and how it occurred, and why it occurred. So at this time, we had over 170 individuals in the building that were escorted out safely. They were taken to a reunification area over at the Annapolis mall.}

If they something that's suspicious, they have a process for what we call rendering that safe. So, the bomb technicians as the officer there mentioned, looks like they determined that, OK, there's no longer a threat with this device. One thing that's interesting that we learned from the press conference is that they've now moved from a tactical response to an investigative response. He mentioned the QRT there, Quick Response Team, their SWAT team has cleared the building. So, at least they're safe now saying that there is no additional threat, no additional victim that's inside the location. So then, we move to that investigation and that will continue. There are a lot of questions we have.

Was this person someone who thought that he could live through this and then tell a story or did he go there thinking that this would be his last day on the face of the ear, we just don't know. And again, you know, at some point, officers will have to present this person before a judge so this is that critical time where they're going to do everything they can to conduct that interrogation to gather as much information as they can.}
