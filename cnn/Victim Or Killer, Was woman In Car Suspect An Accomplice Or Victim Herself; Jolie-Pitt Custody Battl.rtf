But those two people, Bailey Bozwell, the 24-year-old young woman, and Aubrey Trail, her 51-year-old boyfriend weren`t actually charged with this for a long time and were making strange videos and strange overtures.}

And by the way, in these strange interviews, let`s be really clear, he is taking responsibility, but he is also being very clever not to say I murdered her. He is saying it was some sex accident gone wrong. But there is one really big problem with that theory, Paul. And that is a videotape of this pair at the home depot buying things that you can use to cut up a body. And when were they buying those things, Paul?}

And then later after work, later that`s when Sydney Loofe shows up for the second tinder date. So the dismembering tools or the alleged dismembering tools were purchased well before any sex accident is alleged to have happened. That is very significant, Paul.}

Before these two are even charged with anything they reportedly posted this thing on Facebook and I can`t even describe how odd it is.

Hopefully not. I do not think I`m a vindictive revengeful person. If change were truly possible in her case, then, perhaps, parole release could be justified.

When we come back after the break, I want to ask you if there`s any possibility, Greg, that Wanda Barzee could be held longer, if there`s anything that the system could see in this woman and say she`s not ready, and then, I also want to play a moment from Elizabeth Smart where when she was dressed like this and veiled by her captors, and a policeman approached, what was it that held her back from saying help me, help me, rescue me, these people have captured me, because that didn`t happen. That`s next.}

She is serving her 15-year state commitment, that ends in 2024 as you`ve discussed, and she will never be in a prison again for this conduct. The only way she could be housed after that time is if the Utah State Prison authorities decide, Ashleigh, that she is a danger to herself or others, to the point where she needs to be housed in the state mental hospital, and that`s a secure facility. It`s a place where she cannot get out and it`s a place that she could be ordered to go. And it`s actually a place where she served her first 9-1/2 years of this commitment while they were trying to decide if she was even competent to go to trial, and if she was even able to help the attorneys who are representing her at the trial.}

Wilkins says that she averaged just under $14,400 a year during her three years with the team. Well, Rowdy, that guy on the left, he raked in $65,000 a year. Just think about that for a minute.
