We're talking about sort of holding pens, if you like, geographically outside of the European Union's borders to try and process migrant asylum claims.

But at least Italy feels here that it has a stronger commitment from other E.U. countries that the asylum process really does needs some radical reform from here to spread the load.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 DOS SANTOS: Well, when it comes to the disembarkation centers that for instance is something hat the UNHCR has been floating for some time. So there has been some preparatory work that's been done on that. Obviously, what they have to do is to agree with deals with countries like for instance like Morocco, Libya, and other countries.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 The E.U., as I said before, does have some (Inaudible) this because after the waves of migration that we saw coming across the Mediterranean, particularly towards Greece rather than Italy in 2015. They did agree to a significant deal with Turkey, which agreed to keep the migrants back. But of course, the E.U. has to fund that.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 So the question now will be deals with some of these countries, particularly in North Africa and also how to fund those countries so that they can house people in humane conditions to process their asylum claims. There is a lot of work that will have to be done on a number of these initiatives. When it comes to for instance giving more money to front border control system, the maritime border control that can police the Mediterranean Sea to prevent some of these ships who are heading towards Malta and Italy where they've been recently turned back from.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 STEVEN ERLANGER, CHIEF DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES: Well, it was a very long night, first of all. And this is political crisis. It's not a migration crisis really, because migration has fallen considerably in Europe. But the push of migrants a few years ago has created a lot of populous party surges all over Europe, including in Germany.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And it has created a populous Italian government. So basically, it was Italy and Germany who both came to Brussels under pressure to do something to satisfy their populous parties and their more conservative wings about a crisis that really is no longer a crisis but has become a really political sore point. Now, Europe has been vague about asylum for a long time.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 Every country has a different asylum policy, which is part of the problem. And there were two things going on. The Italians want to stop migrants from coming because they end up in Italy, Greece, Spain. So they actually also talked about voluntary screening centers inside Europe where migrants would let's say processed in Italy and be sent to be screened and then either treated as refugees and dispersed to other countries or sent home.}
{\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24\par}\pard\plain\itap0\s0\fi0\sb200\sa0\aspalpha\aspnum\adjustright\ltrpar\li0\lin0\ri0\rin0\qj\faauto\sl260\slmult0\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24{\rtlch\af2\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\b0\i0\fs20\lang1024\langnp1033\langfe1024\langfenp1033
\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 In other words, Italy would no longer be responsible for them all the time or Greece or Spain, as well as these so called disembarkation block forums. They help to setup outside Europe, normally in North Africa to prevent people from going to sea in the first place. And then those people are rescued at sea before they get to Europe, presumably would be sent back to these third countries' centers for screening.}
{\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24\par}\pard\plain\itap0\s0\fi0\sb200\sa0\aspalpha\aspnum\adjustright\ltrpar\li0\lin0\ri0\rin0\qj\faauto\sl260\slmult0\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24{\rtlch\af2\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\b0\i0\fs20\lang1024\langnp1033\langfe1024\langfenp1033
\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 So the whole idea is to keep people from coming, to screen them before they come, not to let NGOs ferry them to Europe. And then for the Germans to be more strict about internal controls inside Europe so that migrants who are registered in Italy, Greece or other countries cannot just wander into Germany and seek asylum. That's been their problem. So you have these two problems with two major countries both trying to score political points. And for Merkel to make sure she keeps in power because there's a threat to her.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 ERLANGER: Well, we'll have to see. I think it does in the sense that she was arguing all the time that you couldn't have a German solution. You needed a European solution. That you couldn't just as her interior minister wants to do, and is in her government but is a rival and facing state (Inaudible). You couldn't setup border controls between Germany and Austria because then the Austrians would start setting up border controls.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And the whole (Inaudible) program of border free travel would begin to fall apart. So she was pressing for a European solution. I think this does help. I mean the current regulations have obviously been a failure, and Europe will be facing migration for decades and decades to come.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 MAXWELL: It's situational awareness. You need to train your staff, whether you're running a business that deals with the public every day or you're running a newspaper. You know I think we're very foolish to assume that the press is immune from these acts of violence. You know the press deals with the public every day just like public agencies and businesses do.}

So the training is not only important for the police departments, but training staff to be aware, because this is just as important as responding to a fire alarm nowadays.}

We now know that President Donald Trump and the Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet face-to-face on July 16th in Helsinki, Finland. What we don't know? The specifics of what they will discuss.

Let's talk about with James Davis, James, the Dean of the School of Economics and Political Science at the University of St. Gallen live for us in Munich, Germany, a pleasure to have you with us, James. President Trump again casting doubt on whether Russia meddled in the election, essentially saying that they say they had nothing to do with it, this again in direct contrast to what we've heard from the intelligence community.}

But at least, one can say this meeting is going to take place after the NATO summit. We were afraid it might take place beforehand. And so one would hope that the President would go into this meeting with a clear agenda backed by his allies in NATO and, you know, maybe get some serious business done.}

They have defined their interests in the region. They've clearly sided with Assad, and it's clear that Assad is going to win this civil war. The Russians have realized that with the Iranians they have a chance to get back into the larger geopolitical game in the Middle East, a game the Americans have not been playing very well.

What's interesting to note as well that what Kristie was talking about accessing these tunnels from above the caving system, what that is allowing the rescuers to do is actually navigate around a passage or a chamber that is currently flooded. So that is the strategy that they're going for here because the water, the rains across that region have been relentless. It is the southwest monsoon and the rainfall continues to come. And it's come with quite a vengeance as well. Look at the challenging conditions that these people have to deal with, the rescuers, muddy conditions, trampling through the forest and jungle floor.}

This is one of the specialized divers that have brought in the British dive team to come and search in the rest or aid and the rescue efforts, and then what you're looking at here is a close-up perspective of quite a group of people here. But there's the pumping system trying to take the water out of the cave system. This is the entrance to the cave in Northern Thailand. There's the water being pumped out. Of course, a monumental effort to try and take out the flood waters. Now, also, think about the waters entering this cave system.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 That has been lifted because the rain abated temporary. But going forward as you can see the forecast radar calls for more showers, more thunderstorms to develop, and sometimes these storms can setup right over that region for a long period of time creating heavy miles of rain in a short period of time and localized flooding, and of course, that water has nowhere to go. It seeks its own level. So it goes into the lowest (INAUDIBLE) the lowest chambers of this caving system. You can see the weather forecast going forward through the weekend.
